        doi: 10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.944593
        description: Building upon my postgraduate research, I turned to a deeper analysis of Scottish journalism, namely the representations of colonial Australia in the early years of the nineteenth century. This article represents my first work on Scissors-and-Paste journalism.

    #     title: Scissors and Paste, Edges and Nodes
    #     summary: Building upon the success of my research into representations of Australia, I wished to delve deeper into the networks that arose from Scissors-and-Paste practices. Institutional funding for training and equipment allowed me to develop new methodologies for determining not only reprinting, but directionality and branching within these networks.

        doi: 10.1080/13555502.2013.865977
        description: As I developed as a writer and researcher, I found myself increasingly concerned with the current publication ecosystem. This article, one of a four-part collection on open access within the humanities, consolidated my views on the ethical and practical impetus to move toward new publication models.
